Project goal: 
The Goal is to analyze and visualize the fluctuations in meteorite landings over the past 20 years, 10 years, and today.
The focus will be on understanding how the numbers and sizes of meteorites vary across different geolocations worldwide.
Datasets:
Source Website: Meteorite Landings - Catalog (data.gov)
Dataset: Meteorite_Landings.csv
Selection Criteria:
1.	Name
2.	ID
3.	Year when meteorite was found/fell.
4.	Mass of meteorite
5.	Geolocation
Potential Questions to answer:
1.	How many meteorites fallen each year?
2.	How has the frequency of meteorite landings changed over the past 20 years, 10 years, and today?
3.	Are there specific geolocations that have experienced a significant increase or decrease in meteorite landings?
4.	How do the patterns of meteorite landings differ across the specified time periods?
5.	Are there any trends or anomalies in the data that stand out during the analysis?

Tasks:
1.	Data cleaning (to handle any inconsistencies or missing values)
2.	Discuss with a team to select the most appropriate visualization tools.
3.	Implement new library (charts.js)

Steps:
1.	GitHub Repository Setup 
2.	Dataset Retrieval
3.	Readme Setup 
4.	Database Setup with MongoDB
5.	Export Json/ CSV for map reference
6.	Set up Flask Environment for Visualization
7.	Database Views and dropdown
8.	JSON Data visualization
9.	Use charts.js to plot yearly total of meteorite lending from DF
10.	HTML formatting map/legend/markers/colors/drop down box
11.	Hover View Setup for each marker 
12.	Slide Deck Creation
